## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section will provide a clear explanation of the key mathematical concepts used in credit risk modelling, with strict adherence to LaTeX formatting rules:

*   **Logistic Regression:**
    The logistic regression model estimates the probability of default $P(Default)$ as a function of explanatory variables $X$:
    $$P(Default) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta^T X)}}$$
    where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\beta$ are the coefficients.  The goal is to estimate these coefficients to best fit the observed default data. This requires maximizing a likelihood function or minimizing a loss function.

*   **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC):**
    AUC measures the ability of a model to discriminate between defaulting and non-defaulting obligors.  It represents the probability that a randomly chosen defaulting obligor will have a higher predicted probability of default than a randomly chosen non-defaulting obligor.  An AUC of 1 indicates perfect discrimination, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates no discrimination. The AUC can be calculated as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings.

*   **Gini Coefficient:**
    The Gini coefficient is another measure of discriminatory power. It is related to the AUC by the formula:
    $$Gini = 2 \cdot AUC - 1$$
    A Gini coefficient of 1 indicates perfect discrimination, while a Gini of 0 indicates no discrimination. The Gini coefficient can be visually interpreted as the area between the ROC curve and the line of equality (the diagonal line representing random chance).

*   **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):**
    VIF quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in a regression model. The VIF for the $i$-th predictor is calculated as:
    $$VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}$$
    where $R_i^2$ is the coefficient of determination for the regression of the $i$-th predictor on all other predictors. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 (depending on the chosen threshold) suggests that multicollinearity may be a problem.

*   **Population Stability Index (PSI):**

    The PSI measures the shift in the distribution of obligors across rating grades between two time periods (e.g., development sample and validation sample). It is calculated as:

    $$PSI = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Actual\%_i - Expected\%_i) \cdot \ln\left(\frac{Actual\%_i}{Expected\%_i}\right)$$

    where $Actual\%_i$ is the percentage of obligors in rating grade $i$ in the validation sample, $Expected\%_i$ is the percentage of obligors in rating grade $i$ in the development sample, and $N$ is the number of rating grades. A higher PSI indicates a greater shift in the distribution. A PSI above 0.1 may warrant further investigation, while a PSI above 0.25 suggests a significant shift that may require model recalibration.
    
*   **Hosmer-Lemeshow Test:**
    The Hosmer-Lemeshow test assesses the calibration of a logistic regression model. It divides the predicted probabilities into $g$ groups (e.g., deciles) and compares the observed number of defaults in each group to the expected number of defaults based on the predicted probabilities. The test statistic is calculated as:
    $$H = \sum_{i=1}^{g} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{N_i \pi_i (1-\pi_i)}$$

    where $O_i$ is the observed number of defaults in group $i$, $E_i$ is the expected number of defaults in group $i$, $N_i$ is the number of obligors in group $i$, and $\pi_i$ is the average predicted probability of default in group $i$. The test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with $g-2$ degrees of freedom. A p-value below a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) suggests that the model is poorly calibrated.

    **Real-World Applications:**

*   *Logistic Regression:* Widely used in credit scoring and PD estimation due to its interpretability and ease of implementation.
*   *AUC & Gini:* Used to compare the performance of different models and to assess the riskiness of a portfolio.
*   *VIF:* Essential for ensuring the stability and interpretability of regression models.
*   *PSI:* Used to monitor the stability of a credit scoring model over time.
*   *Hosmer-Lemeshow:* Used to make sure our model is well-calibrated.

*   **Derivations:**
    The notebook will provide step-by-step derivations of the key formulas and concepts as needed. For example, the derivation of the logistic regression likelihood function will be included.

## 3. Code Requirements

*   **Input/Output Expectations:**

    *   **Input:** The notebook will expect a CSV file containing financial statement data and a default flag. The specific columns required are detailed in the "datasetDetails" section of the prompt, including profitability ratios, leverage ratios, liquidity ratios, a management experience score, industry, size, and a default flag.
    *   **Output:** The notebook will produce a credit rating model, visualizations of the data and model performance, a mapping of PDs to rating grades, and a calibration report. The model will output predicted probabilities of default (PDs) for each obligor.  These PDs will then be mapped to an 8-grade rating scale. The notebook will also generate a comprehensive model documentation report.

*   **Algorithms and Functions (Without Code):**

    *   **Data Quality Checks:** A function to identify and handle missing values using median imputation. Another function to winsorize outliers (capping extreme values). A function to detect and reject impossible values (e.g., negative assets). These functions must track adjustments in a data log.

## 4. Additional Notes or Instructions

*   **Assumptions:** The notebook assumes that the input data is in a structured format (e.g., CSV) and contains the necessary financial statement information and default flag.  It also assumes that users have a basic understanding of credit risk modelling and statistical concepts.
*   **Constraints:**  The notebook is designed to be a self-contained tutorial.
*   **Customization:**  The notebook will be designed to be easily customizable. Users will be able to modify the default definition, segmentation criteria, feature engineering steps, model parameters, and rating scale mapping.  A configuration section at the beginning of the notebook will allow users to adjust these parameters.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** The notebook will emphasize the importance of meeting UAE regulatory guidance for internal rating systems.  The narrative will highlight how every modelling decision aligns with these requirements, including the choice of default threshold, segmentation logic, and long-run PD calibration. The model documentation will specifically address these regulatory considerations.
*   **Reproducibility:** The notebook will provide code cells that reproduce each step of the model development process, enabling independent validation and auditing. A clear and concise code ensures it is easy to rerun from start to end.
*   **Model Choice Rationale:** We will emphasize transparency & regulatory acceptance, logistic expected to be champion unless tree-based offers “significantly better fit without overfitting”.
