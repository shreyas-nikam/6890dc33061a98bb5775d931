# Credit Rating Model Development Codelab

This codelab provides a comprehensive guide to developing a wholesale credit rating model using Streamlit and the UCI Taiwan Credit Default dataset. This application allows you to interact with the data, explore feature engineering options, train and compare different machine learning models, and calibrate the model outputs to generate a credit rating scale. This is a valuable tool for understanding the intricacies of model development and observing the impact of various parameters on the model's outcome.

## Understanding the Credit Rating Model

Duration: 00:05

This application aims to guide you through the process of building a credit rating model. Credit rating models are essential tools for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. By understanding the factors that contribute to credit risk, lenders can make informed decisions about lending and pricing. This codelab explains how financial ratios and statistical methods are used to build a credit rating model, covering data transformations, model training, evaluation, and calibration.

## Navigating the Application

Duration: 00:02

The application is divided into three main sections, accessible via the sidebar:

*   **Data Exploration:** Load, preview, and clean the dataset.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Create and transform features for model training.
*   **Model Training:** Train, evaluate, and calibrate machine learning models.

You can navigate between these sections using the dropdown menu in the sidebar.

## Data Exploration

Duration: 00:15

### Loading the Dataset

1.  Navigate to the "Data Exploration" section using the sidebar.
2.  Click the "Load UCI Taiwan Credit Default Dataset" button. The application will fetch the dataset from the UCI repository.

<aside class="positive">
The application uses `ucimlrepo` to easily fetch the dataset.  This simplifies the process of obtaining the data for analysis.
</aside>

### Previewing the Raw Data

Once the dataset is loaded, you can view the first few rows of the raw data. This allows you to get a sense of the data structure and content. Observe the columns and their potential values.

### Examining Missing Values

The application automatically checks for missing values in the dataset.  A table displays the columns with missing values and the number of missing entries in each.  If no missing values are found, an informative message will be shown.

### Understanding the DataFrame Shape

The "DataFrame Shape" section displays the number of rows and columns in the dataset. This provides an overview of the dataset's size.

### Reviewing Summary Statistics

The `describe()` method provides summary statistics for each numerical column, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. This gives you insights into the distribution of the data.

### Applying Data Quality Checks

This section allows you to apply basic data cleaning techniques:

1.  **Enable Mean Imputation:** Check the box to fill missing numerical values with the mean of their respective columns.
2.  **Outlier Threshold:** Use the slider to set the outlier threshold (in standard deviations). Values beyond this threshold will be capped.
3.  Click the "Apply Data Quality Checks" button to apply the selected cleaning steps.

After applying the data quality checks, you can view a preview of the processed data, check for remaining missing values, and review updated summary statistics.

## Feature Engineering

Duration: 00:25

### Accessing the Feature Engineering Section

Navigate to the "Feature Engineering" section using the sidebar. Ensure you have completed the data exploration steps, as this section relies on the processed data.

### Imputing Missing Values

If there are still missing values after the data quality checks, you can impute them using the "Imputing Missing Values" section:

1.  Select the imputation strategy (currently only 'median' is available).
2.  Click the "Apply Missing Value Imputation" button.

<aside class="negative">
Currently, only median imputation is supported. Adding more strategies, such as mean or mode imputation, could improve the application.
</aside>

### Winsorizing Outlier Values

Winsorization is a technique to reduce the impact of outliers:

1.  Select the columns you want to winsorize.
2.  Adjust the "Lower Quantile" and "Upper Quantile" sliders to set the capping thresholds.
3.  Click the "Apply Winsorization" button.

### Calculating Financial Ratios

This section demonstrates the calculation of financial ratios.

<aside class="negative">
    <b>Important Note:</b>The UCI Taiwan Credit Default dataset does not contain raw financial statement data. Therefore, this function uses <b>dummy data</b> based on `LIMIT_BAL` to illustrate the calculation. In a real application, you would use actual financial figures.
</aside>

1.  Click the "Calculate Ratios" button to calculate these ratios using dummy data.
    The ratios will be added as new columns to the DataFrame. The calculated ratios include Return on Assets (ROA), Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio, and Cash Flow Coverage Ratio.

### Creating a Management Experience Score

This section creates a synthetic "Management Experience Score" based on existing features:

1.  Adjust the weights for `EDUCATION`, `MARRIAGE`, `AGE`, and average `PAY_X` using the sliders.
2.  Click the "Create Score" button to calculate the score.

$$
\text{Management Experience Score} = (\text{EDUCATION} \cdot \text{EduWeight}) + (\text{MARRIAGE} \cdot \text{MarriageWeight}) + (\text{AGE} \cdot \text{AgeWeight}) + (\text{Average PAY\_X} \cdot \text{PayXWeight})
$$

### Applying Quantile Binning

Quantile binning transforms continuous variables into discrete bins:

1.  Select the columns you want to bin.
2.  Set the number of bins.
3.  Click the "Apply Quantile Binning" button.

### Feature Exploration Visualizations

This section allows you to visualize the data after feature engineering:

1.  **Histograms and Box Plots:** Select a feature to visualize its distribution using a histogram and box plot.
2.  **Univariate AUC/Gini for Predictors:** Calculate and display the AUC and Gini coefficient for each numerical feature against the target variable. This helps assess the predictive power of individual features.

### Data Transformation Log

This section creates a log of all the transformations applied to the dataset:

1.  Click the "Generate and Download Data Transformation Log" button to create a YAML file containing the transformation history.

<aside class="positive">
Maintaining a detailed data log is crucial for reproducibility and auditing purposes.

## Model Training, Evaluation, and Calibration

Duration: 00:30

### Accessing the Model Training Section

Navigate to the "Model Training" section using the sidebar. Ensure you have completed the data exploration and feature engineering steps.

### Data Splitting

Before training, the data needs to be split into training and validation sets:

1.  Adjust the "Validation Set Size (%)" slider to set the proportion of data for validation.
2.  Set the "Random State for Reproducibility" to ensure consistent splitting.
3.  Click the "Split Data" button to perform the split.

### Model Training

This section allows you to train different machine learning models:

1.  Select the model type: "Logistic Regression", "Gradient Boosted Trees", or "Random Forest".
2.  Adjust the model-specific parameters (e.g., "Regularization Parameter (C)" for Logistic Regression).
3.  Click the "Train \[Model Name] Model" button to train the selected model.

### Multicollinearity Assessment (VIF)

Assess multicollinearity among features using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):

1.  Click the "Calculate and Display VIF" button to calculate VIF values. High VIF values indicate high multicollinearity.

$$
VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
$$

Where $R_i^2$ is the R-squared value from regressing the $i$-th predictor on all other predictors.

### Model Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance:

1.  Click the "Evaluate Model" button. The application will display the AUC and Gini coefficient for both the training and validation sets.
2.  Review the ROC curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration plots to visualize the model's performance.

### Model Calibration and Rating Grade Mapping

1.  Click the "Calibrate Probabilities" button to calibrate the predicted probabilities.
2.  Set the "Number of Rating Grades".
3.  Click the "Map to Rating Grades" button to map the calibrated probabilities to rating grades.

$$
\text{Scaling Factor} = \frac{\text{Overall Observed Default Rate}}{\text{Overall Predicted Mean Probability}}
$$

### Saving and Loading Model Artifacts

This section allows you to save the trained model and processed data for future use:

1.  Click the "Download \[Model Name] Model" button to save the trained model as a `.joblib` file.
