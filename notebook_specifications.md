## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1. Default Probability (PD)

The foundation of credit risk modeling is the estimation of the probability of default (PD).

$$
PD = P(\text{Obligor defaults within a specified time horizon})
$$

This is a conditional probability, often estimated using statistical or machine learning models based on obligor characteristics.

### 2.2. Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are key indicators of an obligor's financial health. Examples include:

*   **Return on Assets (ROA):** Measures profitability relative to total assets.
    $$
    ROA = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}}
    $$
    A higher ROA generally indicates better financial performance.

*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Measures the proportion of debt used to finance assets relative to equity.
    $$
    \text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}
    $$
    A higher ratio indicates higher leverage and potentially higher risk.

*   **Liquidity Ratios:**  Assess an obligor's ability to meet short-term obligations. The Current Ratio:
    $$
    \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
    $$
    A higher current ratio is better and shows the company is able to cover short-term debts.

*   **Cash Flow Coverage Ratio:** Measures an obligor's ability to cover debt obligations with cash flow.
    $$
    \text{Cash Flow Coverage} = \frac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
    $$
    A higher ratio indicates better debt-servicing capacity.

### 2.3. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., default or no default). The model uses a logistic function to map the linear combination of predictor variables to a probability between 0 and 1.

$$
P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_nX_n)}}
$$

Where:

*   $P(Y=1|X)$ is the probability of default given the predictor variables $X$.
*   $\beta_0$ is the intercept.
*   $\beta_1, ..., \beta_n$ are the coefficients for the predictor variables $X_1, ..., X_n$.

### 2.4. Gradient-Boosted Trees

Gradient-boosted trees are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a strong predictive model.  The algorithm iteratively builds trees, with each tree correcting the errors of its predecessors.  This approach can capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.

### 2.5 Random Forest Models

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training. It addresses the problem of overfitting inherent in single decision trees by averaging or taking a majority vote of the predictions from each tree. This results in a more robust and generally more accurate model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

### 2.5. Gini Coefficient and AUC

The Gini coefficient and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are performance metrics used to evaluate the discriminatory power of a credit risk model.  They quantify the model's ability to distinguish between defaulters and non-defaulters.

The Gini coefficient is defined as:

$$
Gini = 2 * AUC - 1
$$

Where AUC is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. A higher Gini coefficient or AUC indicates better model performance.

### 2.6. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a measure of multicollinearity in a regression model. It quantifies how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases due to multicollinearity.

$$
VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
$$

Where $R_i^2$ is the coefficient of determination for the regression of the $i$-th predictor on all other predictors. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 (depending on the context) suggests high multicollinearity.

### 2.7 Rating Grade Mapping and Calibration

The credit rating model outputs predicted PDs. In many practical scenarios, these PDs must be mapped to a set of ordinal credit rating grades. For instance, a bank may use a rating scale ranging from AAA to D.

Furthermore, predicted PDs must be calibrated against observed default frequencies to ensure that the model's predicted default probabilities align with the actual default experience.
